# twitch-bot
Experimental Twitch bot

This repo uses a raw IRC clien and implements only some features from the Twitch IRC version.
(It parses the tags and stuff, but do help you with proper structs and api for example.)


You can found the successor here: https://github.com/gerifield/coderbot42

The coderbot42 will be created from the experience learned on this project.
It will have a better structure and will use a proper Twitch IRC implementation so I don't have to do everything manually. (But this project helped a lot to understand and see better how I could use the api.)

*No time is wasted spent coding and learning new things.*
